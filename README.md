# T4lk Chat ‚Äì T3 ChatCloneathon Submission

Welcome to **T4lk Chat**, my entry for the [T3 Chat Cloneathon](https://cloneathon.t3.chat/)!

---

## üöÄ About the Project

T4lk Chat is an AI chat app built for the T3 Chat Cloneathon. The focus was on delivering a functional, browser-friendly, and open-source chat experience with support for multiple LLMs, authentication, and chat history sync. The codebase is a true hackathon effort: it works, but it could use a lot of love, refactoring, and cleanup. Enjoy the vibes!

> ‚ö° **Note:** This project was created in a very short time for the challenge. The code is not production-ready and would benefit from a full refactor and cleanup. Expect some rough edges!

## üèóÔ∏è How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- npm or any compatible package manager (pnpm, yarn, bun etc.)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update it with your API keys and settings.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   - If you want to make models available to all users with your api keys, you can set them in the `.env` file.
   - Actually the "title generation" feature requires a dedicated openrouter API, which you can set in the `.env` file or it will use the user api key if available or the default one (if provided in the `.env` file).

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

5. **Open in your browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Enjoy chatting!
